# Habits Tracker

**Habits Tracker** is a simple and intuitive app designed to help you track your habits effectively.

This app is built using **Python with the Flask framework**, **MongoDB**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It includes a date navigation feature that allows you to view past habits and plan for future habits.


## Features

- **Add Habit:**
  You can add a habit to the current date using the **"Add new"** button.

- **Habit Visibility:**
  - Habits will appear on the day they are added and every subsequent day going forward.
  - Habits will not appear on dates before they were added.

- **Completing Habit:**
  You can mark a habit as complete by clicking on its name.

- **Database Structure:**
  The app uses two MongoDB collections:
  - One for created habits.
  - Another for completed habits, keeping completion data organized and separate.
